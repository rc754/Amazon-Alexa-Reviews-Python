# Amazon-Alexa-Reviews-Python
In recent decades, as online marketplaces have become popular, the online vendors and retailers ask their customers to express their views about the items that they purchased.
During their search for goods, these reviews were taken into account by other users. The industry has therefore found the source of providing the correct product searched by the
consumer on the basis of user feedback using the principle of sentimental analysis. In a business setting, sentiment analysis is extremely helpful as it can help understand 
customer experiences, gauge public opinion, and monitor brand and product reputation. Analysing these opinions can be hard and time consuming for product manufacturers. 

## Problem Statement
Amazon is one of the giants of e-commerce that people use every day for online transactions where thousands of reviews can be read, dropped by other customers on their favorite
items.These reviews provide useful views on a product, such as its property, quality and recommendations, which are valuable. This is not only good for buyers, but also supporting
sellers who produce their own items to better understand the customers and their needs. This project explores the issue of sentiment classification for online reviews using
supervised methods to evaluate the overall customer reviews by categorizing them into positive and negative feelings.Apart from quantitative reviews (which are mostly skewed), 
amazon also records qualitative reviews. The objective is to assess those text reviews and determine whether they are negative or positive.
